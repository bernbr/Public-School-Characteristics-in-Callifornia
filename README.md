**Summary:** 
Our data visualization will help us understand different state approaches to virtual learning following the COVID19 outbreak. Additionally, it will provide details on the stateâ€™s approach to virtual learning at different grade levels of education. Our visualizations will support each other by providing different levels of detail. 

**Method:**

1. Analyze the public school characteristic dataset from 2020-2021 to examine district approaches to learning platform (virtual learning) by state and school level. 

2. Create dataframe with aggregations of school level.

3. Create dataframe with aggregations by school level and learning platform.

4. Leverage dataframe with aggregations of school level for interactive map.

5. Leverage data frame with aggregations by school level and learning platform for drop down, pie chart, and bar chart.
